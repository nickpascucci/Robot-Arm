Robot Arm GitHub Repository

This repository contains the content I've created in developing a
robot arm. The arm is built entirely from scratch, with the exception of
an Arduino for control and some servos for movement. All of the parts
are given in QCAD .dxf format, and are machinable on a standard lathe/mill
setup. The project is still under development, and the files will most likely
be revised for clarity at some point in the future when the project is done!
