Robot Arm GitHub Repository

This repository contains the content I've created in developing a
robot arm. The arm is built entirely from scratch, with the exception
of an Arduino for control and some servos for movement. All of the
parts are given in QCAD .dxf format, and are machinable on a standard
lathe/mill setup. The project is mothballed for the time being, but
maybe some of the info here will be of use.
