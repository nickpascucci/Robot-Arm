Notes on the Firmware
by Nick Pascucci

The firmware serves a very simple function: to relay data back and forth
between the computer and the servos. All of the servos on this arm design
are capable of communicating over some sort of serial interface. The
Dynamixel AX-12 and AX-18 servos use half-duplex asynchronous serial
to communicate, and the OpenServos use I2C/TWI to send and receive data.
For that reason, there are two means of querying the servos and setting
their positions; the firmware will select between these based on the 
number of the servo requested by the computer client software.

These numbers are:
0: The base AX-12 servo.
1: The shoulder AX-18 servo.
2: The elbow AX-12 servo.
3: The first end positioner servo. This is in axis.
4: The second end positioner servo. This is a pin joint servo.
5: The third end positioner servo. This is in axis.
