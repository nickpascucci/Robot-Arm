Communications Protocol

This text file describes the protocol used to communicate between
the Arduino controlling the arm and the desktop client software.

The basic structure of a packet from the desktop client to the 
Arduino is as follows:
$P:512@1#

The dollar sign indicates the beginning of a packet. The letter
following indicates the type of packet. The colon indicates the 
value of that parameter. The @ and following number indicates the 
servo address. The hash indicates the end of the packet.

Packet types are as follows:
P: Position. Followed by 0-1023 to indicate the angle of the servo.
S: Speed. Followed by 0-1023 to indicate the speed of the servo.
T: Torque. Followed by 0 or 1 to indicate whether torque is enabled.

The Arduino firmware interprets these packets and sends appropriate
commands to the arm.

Serial multiplexer channels:
0: AX12
1: USB to Serial converter
