-I'll need to order some more Delrin to complete the end manipulator.
-Having parts rapid prototyped with FDM at Mind Studios seems like the 
best way to go for the gripper.

-Remember to turn the torque on in the firmware!
-The servos seem to draw enough current to trip
 the current limiting in the PSU when moving at
 speeds > 50. Might be remedied with a decoupling
 capacitor, or running from 12V -> GND with a regulator
 rather than 12V -> 3.3V.
